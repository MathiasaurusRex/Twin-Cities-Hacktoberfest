### What is Git?

Git is a tool that allows you to back up your code and collaborate with other people.

From Wikipedia:
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
