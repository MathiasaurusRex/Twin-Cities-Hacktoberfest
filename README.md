## What is this?

We'll be building a website together! http://tchacktoberfest.com/ COMING SOON


## What tools will I need?

+ Git / Github
+ HTML ( Written as JSX )
+ CSS
+ JavaScript

## I haven't used one of these things before, where can I learn more about it?

If you're feeling ambitious I highly suggest going through FreeCodeCamp.org to get a understanding of what the following items are. FCC's mission: to help people learn to code for free. We accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public. We also have thousands of freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.

There is no expectation for you to go through FCC before contributing to this project or scheduling some 1:1 time -- but repetition and repeated exposure to topics from different perspectives is often the fastest way to obtain a mastery of a topic.
