The Github Repo for TCHacktoberfest.com

## What is Hacktoberfest?

A month-long celebration from October 1st - 31st sponsored by Digital Ocean and GitHub to get people involved in Open Source. Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open source developer community.

## What is this?

We'll be building a website together! http://tchacktoberfest.com/ COMING SOON


## What tools will I need?

+ Git / Github
+ HTML ( Written as JSX )
+ CSS
+ JavaScript

## I haven't used one of these things before, where can I learn more about it?

If you're feeling ambitious I highly suggest going through FreeCodeCamp.org to get a understanding of what the following items are. FCC's mission: to help people learn to code for free. We accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public. We also have thousands of freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.

There is no expectation for you to go through FCC before contributing to this project or scheduling some 1:1 time -- but repetition and repeated exposure to topics from different perspectives is often the fastest way to obtain a mastery of a topic.


### What is HTML?

In one sentence:
HTML is the language used to create webpages.

From Wikipedia:
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

Guides to help you get started writing HTML:

+ Learning HTML - Guides and Tutorials  : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML
+ Codecademy - Learn HTML : https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html

In this project we will be writing HTML inside of JSX -- JSX is a "sytax extensions" to write HTML inside of Javascript. This has been a very contentious topic over the last couple of years inside of the web development community, but many developers are finding that this way of "HTML / CSS inside of Javascript" to have it's own advantages


### What is CSS?

CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) is the language used to style HTML.

From Wikipedia:

### What is JavaScript?

In one sentence:
Javascript is the langauge used to create custom functionality on web pages.

From Wikipedia:
JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

Additional information:
JS is a term that can be used in many different contexts. One of these contexts has you use JavaScript as a "client-side" language where the developer will create some interaction within the browser. An example of this would be creating a contact form. JS can be used to validate that the information that the user enters before that data gets sent to the server -- creating a better user experience.

"Server-side" where a developer can leverage a javascript library ( in our case express.js ) to run a web server with NodeJS. This web server can be hosted locally ( leveraging your localhost ) or hosted on a service that allows you to run NodeJS ( such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, Zeit )


#### What is ES5/6/7/8
In one sentence: The JavaScript community has come together to agree on a standard that is updated on a yearly basis and features are implemented by the major browsers.

From Wikipedia:
ECMAScript (or ES) is a trademarked scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. It was created to standardize JavaScript, so as to foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#9th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2018)


#### What is React?

In one sentence:
React is a state-based JavaScript library used to create user interfaces.

From Wikipedia:
In computing, React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library))



#### What is NextJS?
#### What is Node?
#### What is NPM ( Node Package Manager ) ? 

### What is Git?
